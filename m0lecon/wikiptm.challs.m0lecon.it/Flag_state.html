					<h1>Flag state</h1>
					<p class="siteSub">From WikiPTM, the free encyclopedia</p>

					<p>The <b>flag state</b> of a <a href="#" class="mw-redirect" title="Merchant vessel">merchant vessel</a> is the <a href="#" title="Jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a> under whose laws the vessel is <a href="#" title="Ship registration">registered or licensed</a>, and is deemed the nationality of the vessel. A merchant vessel must be registered and can only be registered in one jurisdiction, but may change the register in which it is registered. The flag state has the <a href="#" title="Authority">authority</a> and responsibility to enforce regulations over <a href="#" title="Watercraft">vessels</a> registered under its flag, including those relating to inspection, certification, and issuance of <a href="#" title="Safety">safety</a> and <a href="#" class="mw-redirect" title="Ship pollution">pollution</a> prevention documents. As a ship operates under the laws of its flag state, these laws are applicable if the ship is involved in an <a href="#" title="Admiralty law">admiralty case</a>.
                    </p>
					<p>The term "<a href="#" title="Flag of convenience">flag of convenience</a>" describes the business practice of <a href="#" title="Ship registration">registering</a> a <a href="#" title="Merchant ship">merchant ship</a> in a state other than that of the ship's owners, and flying that state's <a href="#" title="Civil ensign">civil ensign</a> on the ship. Ships may be registered under flags of convenience to reduce operating costs, or else to avoid the regulations of, or inspection and scrutiny by, the country of the original owner. Normally the nationality (i.e., flag) of the ship determines the taxing jurisdiction.
                    </p>
					<p>Since the <a href="#" title="Declaration recognising the Right to a Flag of States having no Sea-coast">Flag Right Declaration</a> of 1921, it has been recognised that all states—including <a href="#" class="mw-redirect" title="Land-locked countries">land-locked countries</a>—have a right to maintain a ship register and be a ship's flag state. Because of the failure of some flag states to comply with their survey and certification responsibilities, especially flag-of-convenience states that have delegated their task to <a href="#" class="mw-redirect" title="Classification society">classification societies</a>, a number of states have since 1982 established <a href="#" title="Port state control">port state controls</a> of foreign-registered ships entering their jurisdiction.
                    </p>
					<p>As at January 2010, <a href="#" title="Panama">Panama</a> was the world's largest flag state, with almost a quarter of the world's ocean-going tonnage registered there. The United States and the United Kingdom had only about 1% each.
                    </p>

					<h2 id="History">History</h2>
                    <p>Until <a href="#" title="World War II">World War II</a> nations were able to maintain their dominance, or in some cases, even improve their position in maritime trade by offering vessels exclusive protection for flying their flags, which would in turn give the nation exclusive control over the vessels. Shipowners during this time needed protection from pirates and privateers which was provided by naval vessels of the flag state. In some cases states offered subsidies to the shipbuilding industries. In addition to these incentives, states might impose restrictions based on flag state, closing ports to other ships. One well known example of how this was applied is the case of England, which restricted the import of Asian goods only to American and British vessels. England only opened its ports after it had maneuvered itself into a position of strength, and then most like only to gain access to other continental ports. Similarly, France imposed a trade monopoly on its colonies which remained in place until 1869.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="Ship_register">Ship register</h2>
                    <p>Ships must be registered in the ship register of the jurisdiction whose flag it is flying. Flag registers in many countries are open to ships with foreign owners. Normally, each flag state has only one ship register, but several countries have more than one register:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Denmark, France and Norway maintain an international register to compete with flags of convenience.</li>
                        <li>The <a href="#" title="Kingdom of the Netherlands">Kingdom of the Netherlands</a> allows the different <a href="#" class="mw-redirect" title="Countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands">constituent countries</a> to set up their own registers under the Dutch flag.</li>
                        <li>Several territories over which the <a href="#" class="mw-redirect" title="British Crown">British Crown</a> holds sovereignty have their own register. Most notably, the <a href="#" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a> has a significant register.</li>
                        <li>Hong Kong, the special administrative region of <a href="#" title="China">China</a>, has a separate <a href="#" title="Ship registration in Hong Kong">ship register</a>, the fourth largest in the world, in addition to China's own ship registry.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 id="Flag_state_enforcement">Flag state enforcement</h2>
                    <p>Flag states must, in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law Of the Sea (<a href="#" class="mw-redirect" title="UNCLOS">UNCLOS</a>) ensure that ships under their flag comply with international regulations, often adopted by the UN's International Maritime Organization (<a href="#" title="International Maritime Organization">IMO</a>), on matters of safety, navigation, crewing etc. Part XII entail special provisions on protecting the marine environment, which includes placing special obligations on flag states to ensure compliance with international environmental legislation such as <a href="#" title="MARPOL 73/78">MARPOL</a>. Failure to do so, can result in the flag state losing its jurisdiction over ships under its flag, also when these commit violations on the high seas.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="Flag_state_control">Flag state control</h2>
                    <p>Each flag state has set up its own flag state control system:

                    <ul>
